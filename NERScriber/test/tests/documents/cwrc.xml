        <HEADING SUBTYPE="2"><NAME STANDARD="">Sara Jeannette Duncan</NAME> (1861-1922)</HEADING>
        <P>Sarah Janet Duncan was born on 22 December 1861, the eldest of nine surviving children of Charles Duncan (1834-1907) and Jane ("Jeannie") Bell (1837-1931). She enjoyed a prosperous upbringing due to her father's success as a merchant. She first attended Central School and Brantford Ladies College, and then trained as a teacher at the Brant County Model school, earning her third-class teaching certificate in 1879. She taught school in the Brantford area from 1880 to 1882.</P>
        <P>Her first published prose piece, "Diogenes on Bric-a-Brac," appeared in The Canadian
                Monthly and National Review in June 1880. With an early desire to distinguish herself in literature, she chose to
                pursue a journalistic career, establishing herself with articles about the New
                Orleans Cotton Centennial of 1884 in the London Advertiser (Ontario), the Toronto
                Globe, and the Memphis Appeal. She left New Orleans in May 1885 in order to work in
                a variety of journalistic roles, including some occasional writing for the Globe and
                full-time work on the Washington Post from October 1885 until the spring of 1886.
                She became one of Canada's first regular woman journalists with a daily column in
                the Globe, entitled "Woman's World," and later wrote a similar column,
                "Bric-a-Brac," for the Montreal Star. Working at the Star from the fall of 1887, she
                was made the Star's parliamentary correspondent in Ottawa in March 1888. She
                continued to contribute to periodicals such as The Week, where she used the pen name
                "Garth Grafton."</P>
        <P>Having altered her name to what she considered the more sophisticated "Sara Jeannette,"
                she published her first novel, A Social Departure, in 1890. The novel originated as
                a series of travel sketches written for the Montreal Star in 1888-89, as she
                travelled around the world with fellow journalist, Lily Lewis. In India, Sara met
                Everard Cotes, a Calcutta museum official who later became a newspaper editor and
                Reuters correspondent. Sara completed her journey, staying with Everard's relatives
                in England before returning to Brantford. In the autumn of 1890, Sara travelled back
                to Calcutta, where she married Everard, in St. Thomas's (Free School) Church, on 6
                December 1890.</P>
        <P>Duncan subsequently published serious and comic fiction set mainly in England and India, much of it concerned with Anglo-Indian social and political situations. Many of her novels, especially her earlier works, were first serialized in British and American journals (notably The Lady's Pictorial and the American edition of the Illustrated London News). </P>
        <P>In keeping with the custom of the British in India, the Cotes shared their time between
                Calcutta and Simla, a small Himalayan town that became the headquarters of British
                administration each year during the hot season. During her time in India, Sara
                frequently visited England for extended periods, spending almost as much time in
                London as in India. She also travelled home to Canada a number of times. Living in
                Canada, India, and England gave her a unique perspective on issues of empire, both
                social and political. In the late 1890s, Sara contracted tuberculosis and spent
                months in her Simla garden, exiled from the house, writing a reflective novel on the
                experience: The Crow's Nest (1901; published in England as On the Other Side of the
                Latch).</P>
        <P>Only two of her twenty-two novels deal with Canada: <TITLE LEVEL="MONOGRAPHIC" REF="http://commons.cwrc.ca/islandora:035daa99-d6c3-44a8-9dd2-d2804adf1975">The Imperialist</TITLE> (1904) presents a serious analysis of Canadian identity, while <TITLE LEVEL="MONOGRAPHIC" REF="http://commons.cwrc.ca/islandora:e1afd0a7-c90a-406d-8f69-e5f208f37552">Cousin Cinderella</TITLE> (1908; originally intended to be titled <TITLE LEVEL="MONOGRAPHIC" REF="http://commons.cwrc.ca/islandora:e1afd0a7-c90a-406d-8f69-e5f208f37552">A Canadian Girl in London</TITLE>) takes a lighter look at international social relations. In her later years, Sara wrote plays, many of which were performed, but all of which remain unpublished. She retired with her husband to Chelsea, in London, then to Ashtead, Surrey, where she died of pneumonia on 22 July 1922. She was buried in St. Giles churchyard, in Ashtead, on 26 July 1922.</P>

Interestingly, in their 1919 travel documents, while Everard is listed as a "writer" or "journalist," Sara Jeannette, by far the more famous author, is listed as a "H[ouse]-wife."<BIBCITS> <BIBCIT REF="http://commons.cwrc.ca/islandora:3d805f50-f481-4c5e-8c6c-01f3128c3d04"></BIBCIT><BIBCIT REF="http://commons.cwrc.ca/islandora:5fecdea1-08a0-4dc2-a052-f6fac65912f4"></BIBCIT><BIBCIT REF="http://commons.cwrc.ca/islandora:4e837402-9416-4d89-bf96-6cd0a11f495e"></BIBCIT><BIBCIT REF="http://commons.cwrc.ca/islandora:fc8cdc82-37be-4a8e-af51-551725525049"></BIBCIT><BIBCIT REF="http://commons.cwrc.ca/islandora:2110feb8-57d6-409c-8506-3512190a4a7a"></BIBCIT></BIBCITS></P> </FAMILYMEMBER>
