NERScriber

This project encodes and decodes xml files to and from html.  JavaScript files
are generated for use in the Server project.

The ant build file requires the JJJRMI packed jar file.  This can be found in
the shared lib directory.

To build the project use 'ant -lib ../lib/JJJRMI.packed-0.4.20.jar jar' from the
root directory. The ant tasks will generate JavaScript files which need to be 
checked into git.

When 'ant jar' is called a jar file with the version number will be copied into
the shared lib directory for the project.  Version number and lib directory 
settings can be found in the 'build.properties' file.  The dist directory is
not checked into git because the shared lib directory is.

If the version number changes then the property 'libs.NERScriber.classpath' in the
'lib/nblibraries.properties' file needs to be updated.  This is typcially
maintained by NetBeans.
