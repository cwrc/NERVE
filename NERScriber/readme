NERScriber includes all files for marking up XML documents with named entity tags.
This document serves as instructions for running the NERScriber services.

In order to run a service four files/documents need to be provided.
- A source XML document.
- A RELAXNG schema file.
- A context file.
- A configuration file named config.properties.

The document is provided by the user.  The schema file is typically found in the
href attribute of the xml-model directive (xml-model href="http://cwrc.ca/schemas/orlando_biography_v2.rng").
The context file needs to be provided by the service.  These can be found under
the src/test/resources directory and should be copied to the web service WEB-INF
directory. 

The config.properties file must contain the following fields:
- databaseURL the location of database, this should remain "jdbc:sqlite:".
- databasePath the filepath for the database file, currently in target/nerve.db, 
  this gets changed to WEB-INF/nerve.db when deployed as a web service.
- 
- ner.port a free local port for the Stanford ner to provide service on.  This does
  not have to have external access.
