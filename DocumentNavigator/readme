This project uses antlr to read and write html and xml files.

To build the project use 'ant jar' from the root directory. This will not run
the antlr tasks they need to be called manually with 'ant antlr.gen' or
'ant antlr.clean'.  The ant tasks will add files to the source tree which need
to be stored in git.

When 'ant jar' is called a jar file with the version number will be copied into
the shared lib directory for the project.  Version number and lib directory 
settings can be found in the 'build.properties' file.  The dist directory is
not checked into git because the shared lib directory is.

If the version number changes then the property 'libs.DocNav.classpath' in the
'lib/nblibraries.properties' file needs to be updated.  This is typcially
maintained by NetBeans.
